People should learn reStructuredText and be happy.</h2></a><p>The worst kind of documentation is no documentation. If you want more docs in the world, you need to make it more likely that they will be written. Removing a barrier to doing that (like learning/remembering a markup language) cannot possibly be a bad thing. Many, many OSS projects are one person&#x27;s small gift to the community; it is ungrateful of us to tell them to suck it up and learn a new tool for our benefit.</p><p>Markdown can be just as extensible and rich as reStructuredText given the right syntax for extensions. Don&#x27;t dismiss it until you see a direct comparison. And even if it&#x27;s a little worse, see last paragraph.</p><p>And finally, it&#x27;s okay if this project is not for you. Other people will do what they like.</p><a href="#You-should-have-just-worked-on-Sphinx" name="You-should-have-just-worked-on-Sphinx" class='header-anchor'><h2>You should have just worked on Sphinx</h2></a><p>Sphinx is a fundamental piece of the Python community. This is great for the community, but it also means that radically changing Sphinx could be both difficult and harmful.</p><p>I think Git and Subversion are an analogous pair of projects to Computer Words and Sphinx. Subversion exists and still works great, but Git introduced some new ideas and a lot of people made the switch because they saw a benefit.</p><p>Whether Computer Words has a similar benefit over Sphinx in the long term remains to be seen. My point is that it is still productive to start a new project even when there is already an established one.</p></article></main>
