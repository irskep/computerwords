Using it should not require authors to constantly refer to syntax references or other meta-documentation.</p></li><li><p>Since the documentation is for software, Computer Words should make it easy to integrate with software. Plugins (custom tags) are a core feature.</p></li></ol><a href="#Value-Proposition" name="Value-Proposition" class='header-anchor'><h2>Value Proposition</h2></a><a href="#The-simplicity-of-Markdown-the-power-tools-of-Sphinx" name="The-simplicity-of-Markdown-the-power-tools-of-Sphinx" class='header-anchor'><h3>The simplicity of Markdown, the power tools of Sphinx</h3></a><p>Markdown is the language of GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab. Software developers write Markdown <i>all the time.</i> Since they already know Markdown, why should they learn a different language to write their documentation?</p><p>If you just write a bunch of Markdown files, you end up hosting your docs on a GitHub wiki or some similar abomination. There needs to be some kind of organizing power to bring it together.</p><a href="#HTML-CSS" name="HTML-CSS" class='header-anchor'><h3>HTML &amp; CSS</h3></a><p>The output uses semantic HTML5 markup. That&#x27;s kind of nice.</p><p>It&#x27;s really to include CSS stylesheets. You might think, “I&#x27;m making a web site, so of course I can style it with CSS!” But if you were using <a href='http://sphinx-doc.org'>another tool</a>, you would find this task to be more trouble than you were expecting. Computer Words makes it really, really simple to add your own CSS. And it includes a normalization stylesheet and some pretty good defaults.</p><p>Applying some basic font and color changes is a surprisingly affective way to brand your documentation. You should do it.</p><a href="#Simple-and-powerful-plugin-API" name="Simple-and-powerful-plugin-API" class='header-anchor'><h3>Simple and powerful plugin API</h3></a><p>This isn&#x27;t really true until I document the API, but trust me...it&#x27;s good.</p><a name='why-python-3.5'></a><a href="#Why-Python-3-5-" name="Why-Python-3-5-" class='header-anchor'><h2>Why Python 3.5?</h2></a><p>Most importantly, because it is a pleasure to write. Computer Words uses <tt>pathlib</tt> and <tt>yield from</tt> extensively.</p><p>But also, it forces us to treat earlier versions of Python as a <i>separate language</i>, which makes us more likely to write a better API to support non-Python-3.5 languages!</p><p>I suspect the project runs fine under Python 3.4. But since few people even run Python 3, it might as well be written in OCaml.</p></article></main>
