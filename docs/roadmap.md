# Roadmap

Roughly in order of planned implementation:

1. Semantic linking features. Manually writing out hrefs is error prone and
   annoying.
2. Data structures for "shadow trees," which would let you keep track of the
   order in which nodes appear in the document more efficiently.
3. Robust parsing.
