Computer Words is a tool that helps you write documentation for software. It
is extensible and you can write Markdown. Computer Words is conceptually
similar to [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

The page you are reading was written in
[Computer Flavored Markdown](computer_flavored_markdown.html#computer-flavored-markdown) and compiled
with Computer Words.

<warning>This is alpha-quality software. Most of it works very well, but be
sure to read the parser caveats if you intend to really use it.</warning>

# Basics

```sh
# if necessary, install a version of Python â‰¥ 3.3:
brew install python3.5  # or whatever

# then install Computer Words
pip install computerwords
```

Now you're ready to run! You just need to write a Markdown file and a config.

```markdown filename=docs/index.md
# My Cool Project

Hello world!
```

```json filename=docs/conf.json
{
  "site_title": "My Cool Project",
  "site_subtitle": "The coolest project ever",
  "project_version": "1.0",
  "file_hierarchy": ["*.md"]
}
```

```sh
> python3 -m computerwords --conf docs/conf.json
```

The built docs are now in `docs/build/`.
